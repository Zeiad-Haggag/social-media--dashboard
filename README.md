# Social Media Dashboard with Theme Switcher

## Overview
This project is a Social Media Dashboard designed to track followers, engagement metrics, and statistics across multiple platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. The interface is enhanced with a Dark Mode and Light Mode theme switcher, providing users with the ability to toggle between different viewing experiences.

## Technologies Used

1.HTML5: Structuring the webpage with clean, semantic markup.  
2.Sass (SCSS): For maintaining modular and reusable stylesheets, simplifying complex CSS with variables, nesting, and mixins.  
3.JavaScript (ES6+): Handling the dynamic theme switching functionality and interactivity of the dashboard.  
4.Gulp: Automating tasks such as compiling Sass into CSS, minification, and live reloading for a seamless development experience.  

## Features

1.Theme Switcher: Users can toggle between Light Mode and Dark Mode using a simple switch. The theme selection is saved to local storage, so it persists between page reloads.  
2.Responsive Design: The dashboard is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across various devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).  
3.Dynamic Data Display: The dashboard displays real-time data for social media metrics such as follower count, likes, and views for multiple platforms.  
4.Accessible Design: The project follows best practices for accessibility, including high-contrast color themes and keyboard navigability.
